# Real time analytics: Kafka + Druid + Superset

### What is Druid?
Apache Druid (incubating) is a real-time analytics database designed for fast slice-and-dice analytics ("OLAP" queries) on large data sets. Druid is most often used as a database for powering use cases where real-time ingest, fast query performance, and high uptime are important. As such, Druid is commonly used for powering GUIs of analytical applications, or as a backend for highly-concurrent APIs that need fast aggregations.

### What is Superset?
Apache Superset is a data exploration and visualization web application and provides an intuitive interface to explore and visualize datasets, and create interactive dashboards.

- A rich set of data visualizations
- An easy-to-use interface for exploring and visualizing data
